"""
To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 ans 20, and 
based on the result of the random number, we check to see if it fails under certain range
if the number is greater than 15, then the result will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is greater than 10, then the result will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is greater than 5, then the result will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is greater than 2, then the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is greater than 1, then the result will be "Bell"
otherwise the number is not any of the above, then the result will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user. As an example "Plum Cherries Melon"
